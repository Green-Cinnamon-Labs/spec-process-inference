# Semantic Orchestrator of Work — Vision

## Purpose

> Define the core objective of the simulation framework.
> Clarify what problem this project exists to solve.
> State what this system is — and what it is not.

---

## Strategic Direction

> Describe current maturity level.
> Define next architectural step.
> Clarify long-term structural ambition.
> Explicitly state what is out of scope.

---

## Architectural Philosophy

> State separation principles (model, integrator, engine, supervision).
> Define what must never be coupled.
> Clarify invariants of the architecture.

---

## Deterministic Engine

> Define how time is governed.
> Define numerical control strategy.
> State reproducibility requirements.
> Clarify execution loop ownership.

---

## Long-Term Evolution

> List supported model types.
> Define extensibility expectations.
> Clarify supervisory integration strategy.
> Define constraints for future expansion.

---

## Engineering Standard

> Define validation criteria.
> Define traceability expectations.
> Define reproducibility requirements.
> Clarify documentation standards.
